## Keybindings

You can control the calculator entirely from the keyboard.  
Each key (or key combination) corresponds to a specific button or operation.

| Keys / Combos | Action |
|----------------|---------|
| `0`, `p` | 0 |
| `1`, `q` | 1 |
| `2`, `w` | 2 |
| `3`, `e` | 3 |
| `4`, `r` | 4 |
| `5`, `t` | 5 |
| `6`, `y` | 6 |
| `7`, `u` | 7 |
| `8`, `i` | 8 |
| `9`, `o` | 9 |
| `.`, `,` | Decimal point (.) |
| `-`, `Shift + m` | Subtract (-) |
| `√`, `Shift + s` | Square root (√) |
| `/`, `Shift + /`, `Shift + d` | Divide (÷) |
| `+`, `Shift + +`, `Shift + p` | Add (+) |
| `*`, `Shift + *`, `Shift + t` | Multiply (×) |
| `=`, `Shift + e`, `Enter` | Equals (=) |
| `Backspace`, `x` | Delete (DEL) |
| `Ctrl + c` | Clear (C) |
| `Escape` | All Clear (AC) |

< Tip : when using Vimium, go into insert mode (i) to make all keybindings work correctly.

# Post Scriptum
I allow myself to work on this in the future if I want,
I would maybe only like to create a header or footer,
but I have been working on this for so long that I just want
to get to the node or ruby course ASAP, so I'll leave it 90% done.
